PoliScIR
========

This is a head-to-toe builder for the PoliScIR API.


How it Works
------------

This repo includes a build.R file, which downloads and formats a large
collection of datasets that are commonly employed in IR literature (The
complete list of Datasets and Citations is provided below).

The build.R file then checks slices the files into valid tables. These
can be exported to SQL, CSV, XML, JSON, etc...
